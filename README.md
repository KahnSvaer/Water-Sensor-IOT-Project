# Water-Sensor-IOT-Project
## Overview
This project automates water quality testing using IoT and machine learning. It combines test strip reading, motorized sampling, and remote data access. Key features include advanced image processing, mobile integration via Flutter and Firebase.

---

## Key Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Automatically adjusts brightness, contrast, and orientation.
- **Strip Alignment**: Detects and aligns test strips for further analysis.
- **Segmentation**: Identifies and isolates specific regions of interest (e.g., test strip boxes).
- **Color Analysis**: Measures color changes to determine chemical properties.
- **Scalable Design**: Easily integrates with IoT and cloud solutions.
- **Efficient**: Processes images quickly and effectively, even on resource-limited devices.
